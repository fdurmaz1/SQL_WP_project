# SQL_WP_project
This project involves creating and managing a database called "WP", focusing on organizational departments and employees. It includes the initial creation of the database, defining structures for departments and employees, and populating these tables with relevant data. Additionally, the project encompasses advanced SQL queries and views to extract and organize information, such as employee details and departmental assignments. This provides a practical example of using SQL for database management and data retrieval in an organizational context.<br><br>
